Hi! Nice to see you! I really like the bread you made.
Baker
Thanks. Our family had been made the bread since fourteenth century.
Lady
Really? That's a long time. Why did you made it for such long?
Baker
That's a long story. It will back to my ancestor when he was just a teenager in the fourteenth century London...
